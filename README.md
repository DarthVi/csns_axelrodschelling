# Cultural dissemination and segregation: the Axelrod-Schelling model

## About the code

This is an implementation of the Axelrod-Schelling model which makes use of the Peersim cycle-driven simulation engine. It has been done for
the course of Complex Systems and Network Science at the Alma Mater University of Bologna. However, since I found prototyping in peersimm too slow and I needed to be on time with the project deadline, I coded a Netlogo version (you can find it here: https://github.com/DarthVi/csns_netlogoP) which records additional useful statistical data while running the simulation. The core code of this version is complete, but it lacks the aforemetion stats recording and other data logging. Moreover it builds a "dynamic csv" that must be analyzed in Gephi (see more details about dyanamic csv data in the Gephi official documentation).
